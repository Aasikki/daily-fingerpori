# Daily Fingerpori for Home Assistant
Downloads daily fingerpori comic from http://fingerpori.org/ and displays it as an image entity in Home Assistant.

Best when used with together my comic card https://github.com/Aasikki/comic-card but of course you can use any card that can display images from image entities, like the build in picture card.
